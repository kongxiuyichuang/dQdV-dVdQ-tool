# dQdV-dVdQ-tool
Provides lithium-ion battery differential capacity and differential voltage analysis tools, including MATLAB version and HTML version
IC_An.m&IC曲线分析工具-V1.0.html uses sliding window differential analysis method to retain more curve detail information.
IC_tool.m uses fitting interpolation and then differential processing, which has faster processing speed.
